# AR Circuit Board

In this repo is the Unity project that was created for my Final year project. If you want to find out more about the project I wrote a full disertation on ther subject which is inculded in this repo.  

This proejct is an AR appliction to help teach how to create electrical circuits on a breadboard. It works by pointing your phone at the QR code and then it was display a visual of the breadboard for you to use to help create a working electrical circuit.  

Below are soem images of the project.
